## Introduction

This is a simple CRUD application built with Symfony 6.3 and MySQL 8.0. It uses the [Symfony Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html) to create the project and the [Doctrine ORM](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html) to handle the database interactions.

-----------------------
## Steps on how I did the project
### Fresh installation
1. Installed the project using the Symfony CLI.
   ```bash
   symfony new product_test
   ```
2. Installed [Doctrine ORM](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#installing-doctrine) via this command:
   ```bash
   composer require symfony/orm-pack
   composer require --dev symfony/maker-bundle
   ```
3. Changed the database configuration to use MySQL in the `.env` file.
4. Run the migrations: *(Assuming you have a MySQL database named `product_test`)*
   ```bash
   php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
   ```
5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   symfony server:start
   ```

### Creating the Product entity
Created the `Product` entity via console command:
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:entity
   ```
The `Product` entity is created in the `src/Entity` directory automatically and will add necessary annotations based on the information you provide in `php bin/console make:entity`.

-----------------------

### Creating the ProductService
Created the `ProductService` class with a namespace `App\Service`. There is no available command to generate the service class just the like an entity. The `ProductService` class is responsible for handling the CRUD operations on the `Product` entity.

The service class has the following methods:

- `products()`: Returns all the products.
- `create()`: Creates a new product.
- `update()`: Updates an existing product.
- `delete()`: Deletes a product.
- `validated()`: Validates the product data.
- `save()`: Saves the product data.

Explanation of each method are provided as comments in the code.

-----------------------

### Creating the ProductController
Created the `ProductController` class via console command:
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:controller
   ```
The `ProductController` class is created in the `src/Controller` directory automatically. It has the following methods:

- `index()`: Returns all the products.
- `show()`: Returns a single product.
- `create()`: Creates a new product.
- `update()`: Updates an existing product.
- `delete()`: Deletes a product.

Explanation of each method are provided as comments in the code.

-----------------------

### Creating the ProductRepository
The `ProductRepository` class is created in the `src/Repository` directory automatically when an entity is created. This was generated by the `make:entity` command of `Product` entity. This class contains the methods to query the database for the products such as `findAll()`, `findOneBy()`, `findBy()`, etc.
